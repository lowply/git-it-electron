<div id="challenge-desc" class="challenge">
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Create a file in your new repository, add something to that file and
    commit those changes with Git.</p>
</div>

<h2>Step: Create a New File</h2>

<p>Now that you've got a repository started let's add a file to it.</p>

<p>Open your text editor and create a new empty file. Now write a little bit of text, perhaps
  type "Hello!", and save the file as 'readme.txt' in the 'hello-world' folder you created in the last challenge.</p>

<h2>Step: Status, Add and Commit Changes</h2>
<p>Next check the <strong>status</strong> of your repository to find out if there have been changes. You know you have changed something, but does Git?</p>

<p>Make sure you're still within your <code>hello-world</code> directory when you're running these commands. Use Git to see what changed in your repository:</p>

<p>First, check the status:</p>
<p><code class="shell">git status</code></p>
<p>Git should tell you that a file has been added.</p>

<p>Then <strong>add</strong> the file you just created so that it becomes a part of the changes you will <strong>commit</strong> (aka save) with Git:</p>
<p><code class="shell">git add readme.txt</code></p>

<p>Finally, <strong>commit</strong> those changes to the repository's history with a
  short (m) message describing the updates.</p>
<p><code class="shell">git commit -m "Created readme"</code></p>

<h2>Step: Make More Changes</h2>
<p>Now add another line to 'readme.txt' and save the file again.</p>

<p>In terminal, you can view the <strong>diff</strong>erence between the
  file now and how it was at your last commit. </p>

<p>Tell Git to show you the <strong>diff</strong>:</p>
<p><code class="shell">git diff</code></p>

<p>Now with what you just learned above, commit this latest change.</p>
