  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Merge your branch locally, delete the branch and pull from upstream for much win!</p>
 </div>

 <h2>Background: Cleaning up</h2>

 <p>Once you don't need branches anymore you can delete them locally and remotely. This is helpful so that you don't end up with a pile of old branches.</p>

<h2>Step: Merge Locally</h2>

<p>Your pull request has been merged! Your branch was merged into the 'gh-pages' branch of the original on GitHub. You can merge your branch locally, too.</p>

<p>First, move into the branch you want to merge into—in this case, the branch 'gh-pages'.</p>
<p><code class="shell">git checkout gh-pages</code></p>

<p>Now tell Git what branch you want to merge in— in this case,
  your feature branch that begins with "add-".</p>
<p><code class="shell">git merge &#60;BRANCHNAME&#62;</code></p>

<p>Tidy up by deleting your feature branch. Now that it has been merged you don't really need it around.</p>
<p><code class="shell">git branch -d &#60;BRANCHNAME&#62;</code></p>

<p>You can also delete the branch from your fork on GitHub:</p>
<p><code class="shell">git push &#60;REMOTENAME&#62; --delete &#60;BRANCHNAME&#62;</code></p>

<h2>Step: Pull from Upstream</h2>
<p>And last but not least, the original has changed since your pull request was merged—Reporobot added your name to the website! If you pull in these changes from upstream you'll be up to date
  and have that version too. You can actually see it live as well at: yourusername.github.io/patchwork.</p>

<p>To pull from the original upstream:</p>
<p><code class="shell">git pull upstream gh-pages</code></p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You've created local repositories, remote repositories, worked with
  a collaborator, pushed, pulled and joined the millions of others
  developing and enriching open source!</p>
