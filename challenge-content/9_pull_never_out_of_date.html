  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Keep your file up to date by pulling in changes from collaborators.</p>
</div>

<h2>Background: Pulling from a Remote</h2>
<p>If you're working on something with someone else you need to stay up
  to date with the latest changes. So you'll want to <strong>pull</strong> in any
  changes that may have been pushed to the central GitHub repository.</p>

<h2>Step: What has Reporobot been up to?</h2>
<p>See if Reporobot has made any changes to your branch by pulling
  in any changes from the remote named 'origin' on GitHub:</p>

<p><code class="shell">git pull &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;</code></p>

<p>If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date'.
  If there are changes, Git will merge those changes into your local
  version.</p>

<p>Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made.
  You can open that file and see Reporobot's updates. Surprise,
  Reporobot is an artist!</p>
