<h2>About Git-it</h2>
<p>Git-it teaches the essential—and most common—Git commands developers use everyday along with the GitHub Flow—the most common practice in collaborating on GitHub.</p>

<p>Some challenges require an internet connection, so you'll need to be online to complete Git-it. But you can always open the app and view the challenges and resources offline.</p>

<h4>Real Development Environment</h4>

<p>Git-it uses the real terminal, Git and GitHub (rather than emmulating them). When you finish you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your contribution chart!</p>

<h4>The Code that Made Git-it</h4>

<p>This app is built with HTML, CSS and JS and uses the <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a> library. All of the code for Git-it is online in its <a href="http://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron" target="_blank">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
