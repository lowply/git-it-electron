<h2>About Git-it</h2>
<p>Git-it is a desktop application with interactive lessons teaching Git and GitHub basics.</p>

<h4>Real Development Environment</h4>
<p>It uses the real terminal (rather than emmulating it) and it uses real Git and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your contribution chart! And what you install to complete Git-it (Git and a text editor) is all you need to continue development after you're doneâ€”you're set up!</p>

<p>Some challenges require an internet connection, so you'll need to be online order to complete Git-it. But you can always open the app and use the guide and resources offline.</p>

<h4>The Code that Made Git-it</h4>

<p>This app is built with HTML, CSS and JS and uses the <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a> library. Read more about its development in its documentation (Coming soon!). <a href="http://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron" target="_blank">Git-it repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
