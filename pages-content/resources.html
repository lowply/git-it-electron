<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Want to reinforce what you just learned or try another way? Here are other resources for learning Git and GitHub.</p>


<h3>Interactive Tutorials</h3>
<p>Similar to Git-it, these are tutorials that you participate in.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Try Git</a> (Uses an terminal emulator) by CodeSchool</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guides, Books and Cheatsheets</h3>
<p>Things to read or query.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">Introduction to Git</a> by Git</li>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git Book</a> by Scott Shacon</li>
  <li><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">Simple Guide</a> by Roger Dudler</li>

  <li><a href="https://training.github.com/kit/">Git Cheatsheet</a> by GitHub</li>
  <li><a href="https://guides.github.com">GitHub Guides</a> by GitHub</li>
</ul>

<h3>GitHub Desktop</h3>
<p>You likely installed this before you started Git-it but if you didn't, here's the link.</p>
<p>The GitHub Desktop app lets you do much of what you can do in terminal (though not all) and is a bit easier to read at times. Personally, I use it to look over anything not small <code>diff</code> I have. Your changes are really nice to see this way.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> (OSX, Windows, Free) by GitHub</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/desktop/">Github Desktop Guides</a> by GitHub</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Cool Stuff</h3>

A great presentation that compares Git commands to writing and mailing a letter. The presentation is in Japanese but the illustrations are clear even if you don't understand the words.
